                <p>I'm a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS
                    feeds.
                    I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.</p>

                <p>First, let me introduce myself. My name is Rabiul Awal, and I’m a full-time full stack with 2
                    years experience. In that time,
                    This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my second year as a developer has been a
                    huge
                    milestone for me. This is because I had no real experience doing web development — and not much
                    programming experience in general beyond some basic C# and Java training I got from a few online
                    courses. I also didn’t have a computer science degree since I graduated with a Business Management
                    degree.</p>

                    <p>Once I covered the fundamentals of web development, I was ready for my first web development
                        interview
                        for an entry level position. I won’t go into details about the interview since this isn’t this
                        article’s
                        main focus. But I will say that I was told my relatively strong JavaScript knowledge help me
                        secure
                        the
                        position. (Thanks, Programming Heros)</p>

                        know
                        about these, they’re great websites that allow you to learn to code by coding inside the
                        browser.

                        I found learning resources like this were the best when you are just getting started. Just be
                        advised
                        that this method of learning gets tiring quickly once you get into more advanced stuff, since
