            <p>I'm a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS
                feeds.
                I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.</p>

            <h2> Become a Programmer</h2>
            <p>First, let me introduce myself. My name is Rabiul Awal, and I’m a full-time full stack with 2
                years experience. In that time,
                This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my second year as a developer has been a huge
                milestone for me. This is because I had no real experience doing web development — and not much
                programming experience in general beyond some basic C# and Java training I got from a few online
                courses. I also didn’t have a computer science degree since I graduated with a Business Management
                degree.</p>
